#### Key Features:

User Authentication: Users must register and log in to access the API. The API uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure endpoints.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles (e.g., Admin, Author, Reader) have varying levels of access:
Admin: Full access to create, read, update, and delete any blog post.

Author: Can create new posts and modify or delete only their own posts.

Reader: Can view posts but cannot create, update, or delete them.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Users with the appropriate role can create new blog posts.
Read: All users (authenticated or not) can view a list of blog posts or details of a single blog post.

Update: Users can edit their own posts, while Admins can edit any post.

Delete: Users can delete their own posts, while Admins can delete any post.


API Features:

Pagination: Blog post lists are paginated to improve performance and user experience.

Sorting and Filtering: Users can sort and filter blog posts based on criteria such as publication date, author, or title.

Error Handling: Detailed and consistent error messages for invalid requests.

Authentication via JWT: All endpoints, except those that retrieve public blog posts, require a valid token to be accessed.
Technologies Used:

Backend Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Database: PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)
